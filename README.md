# ICPC 2D oil extraction algorithm #

disclaimer- This is a brute way of approaching the question. It will be updated with optimized version soon

## Reminder ##
This program only accepts x1 and x2 value in an increasing order. 
If the oil repository spans horizontally from 40 - 50 with height (Y-value) of 50, then insert
```
40 50 50
```
```
wrong example 
50 40 50 
```


solution to this will be fixed in the future update as well
